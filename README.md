## 🚀 Getting Started

Some of these scripts use Tampermonkey, so you'll need to install it. (Mainly the hacks use it).

### 1. Install Tampermonkey

Tampermonkey is available for most browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.

</a>

Tampermonkey has a detailed guide with user support.

### 2. Add Userscripts

Once Tampermonkey is installed, follow the steps below:

1. **Open Tampermonkey Dashboard:** Click on the Tampermonkey icon in your browser toolbar and select "Dashboard."
2. **Create a New Script:** Click on the "+" icon to create a new script.
3. **Paste the Script:** Copy the JavaScript code from this repository and paste it into the script editor.
4. **Save:** Click "File" > "Save" or use the shortcut `Ctrl + S`.

### 3. Enjoy Your Enhanced Experience 😉

### Tutorials on how to operate:

- If you do not see a comment that says `// ==UserScript==`, you should execute it in your console.
- If the script does not have a .js ending, it has to be executed on your local machine, as only EcmaScript can be run in a browser. (Which JS compiles into)

Each script besides these should automatically work, if not contact me on [Discord](https://discord.gg/MqvmBu5tWa) or make an Issue on this repository.
