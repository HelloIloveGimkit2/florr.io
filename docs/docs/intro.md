Welcome to the official documentation for <a href="https://github.com/cat2d2/io" target="_blank" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank'); return false;">`cat2d2/io`</a>

## Getting Started

### What you'll need

- [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net) 
  - Install it based off your browser. Version 82+ recommended

- A userscript of your choice. You can find them in <a href="https://github.com/cat2d2/io" target="_blank" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank'); return false;">`cat2d2/io`</a>

## Create a new script

You can start off by going to the Tampermonkey Dashboard. Click on the extension, then click "Dashboard".

  The default Tampermonkey Dashboard with no scripts installed:

#### Then, create a new script
You can do this by pressing the `+` icon located near the top-right of your screen

## Copy paste your script
So `ctrl` + `c`, then `ctrl` + `v`

Save your script with `ctrl` + `s`

And there you have it! You're scripts are ready to be used.
