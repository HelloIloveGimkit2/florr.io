## Breaking down the Userscript tag
The video you just watched was how to make a new TamperMonkey script and get it running. I skipped over the userscript tag since we will go over it here.

### `@match`
Let's break the userscript tag down starting with `@match`:
![@match](static/@match.png) 
When we create a new script on our desired webpage, [**TamperMonkey**](https://tampermonkey.net) automatically matches it. The `@match` tag tells our userscript manager which webpage to run on. If we want our script to run on every webpage, we can use a few different methods. The one I like to use takes advantage of `@include`, like so:
```
// @include      http://*
// @include      https://*
```
This makes the script include every webpage that is `http` or `https` (Practically every internet site). 

However, it doesn't make the script run on local pages. A good example of a local page for beginners is a new tab. When you press `ctrl` + `t` in a browser like Chrome, it actually goes to `chrome://newtab`. You just don't realize is since it renders as blank. This is a local page since it can be accessed offline. If you go to the advanced tutorial later on, you'll see a much better example: `localhost:xxxx`. 
If we want our script to run really **EVERY** webpage, we can put
```
@match *://*/*
```
A more detailed version of `@match` is shown below:
```
// @match <protocol>://<domain><path>
```
You can find an *even* more detailed description [**here**](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv2/match-patterns) if that still isn't good enough.

In some older versions of TamperMonkey, there was a bug where `@match *` would also work, however for obvious reasons we won't rely on a bug in this tutorial.

### `@require`
`@require` makes your life a lot easier. When developing a project you probably install things from a library, since making them from scratch is very hard. The games on [`cat2d2/io`](https://github.com/cat2d2/io) all have a `node_modules` directory. This website uses Node Modules! But if you want to use somebody elses code in your script without pasting it, you can just tell `@require` what you want. For example:
```
@require      https://unpkg.com/string-similarity@4.0.4/umd/string-similarity.min.js
```

This requires the `string-similarity` package, which measures how similiar two strings are. The `min.js` ending indicates that it is minified, or compressed for faster page loading times.
You can import whatever packages you want, and you can use this tag as many times as you want.

### `@grant`

`@grant` is used to whitelist `GM_*` and `GM.*` functions, the unsafeWindow object and some powerful window functions.
```
// @grant GM_setClipboard
// @grant unsafeWindow
```

### `unsafeWindow`
<details>
  <summary>`unsafeWindow` | A deep dive</summary>

Let's take a look at `unsafeWindow`. This tag allows Tampermonkey to add custom properties set by the web page. 

Let's take a look at this quote.
> _"`unsafeWindow` bypasses the Greasemonkey XPCNativeWrapper-based Security model, which exists to make sure that **malicious** web pages cannot alter objects in such a way as to make greasemonkey scripts (which execute with more privileges than ordinary JavaScript running in a web page) do things that their authors or users did not intend."_ -mmartz, [**Sourceforge.net**](https://sourceforge.net/p/greasemonkey/wiki/unsafeWindow/#:~:text=unsafeWindow%20bypasses%20the%20Greasemonkey%20XPCNativeWrapper,that%20their%20authors%20or%20users)

**Woah.**

That's confusing. Let's break it down step by step.

#### Greasemonkey and Tampermonkey
As you already know, Greasemonkey and Tampermonkey are:
- **Browser Extensions**: Allow users to run custom scripts (userscripts) on web pages.
- **Userscripts**: Modify the behavior and appearance of web pages.

#### Security Model

- **XPCNativeWrapper**: Isolates userscripts from the web page's JavaScript to prevent unintended interactions.

#### `unsafeWindow`

- **Bypass Security**: Allows direct access to the web page's JavaScript objects and functions.
- **Risks**: Exposes userscripts to potential manipulation by malicious web pages.
- **Use Cases**: Necessary for certain tasks like calling web page functions or accessing specific properties.

#### How you should use it

- **Sparing Use**: Use `unsafeWindow` only when absolutely necessary.
- **Trusted Sites**: Ensure the web page is trusted.
- **Alternatives**: Consider other approaches that do not require bypassing the security model.

:::danger
_`unsafeWindow` can also break scripts when used, so you should determine whether or not you need it before you begin coding._
:::

#### Example

```JS
// Here we have our userscript
(function() {
    'use strict';
    // Now we access a function defined by the webpage
    if (typeof unsafeWindow.someFunction === 'function') {
        unsafeWindow.someFunction();
    }

    // and access a property set by the page
    if (unsafeWindow.someProperty) {
        console.log(unsafeWindow.someProperty);
    }
})();
```
In this example our script checks if `someFunction` and `someProperty` exist on the site.
Then it calls `someFunction` and logs `someProperty` using `unsafeWindow`.

That's it! That wasn't so bad was it? Okay, maybe it was a little confusing. However, don't worry since for this beginner tutorial we **won't** use `unsafeWindow` ðŸ˜…

## Userscript Headers
These are some of the biggest userscript tags that aren't rudimentary, such as `@description`.

You can find a full list of headers and API's [**here**](https://www.tampermonkey.net/documentation.php).

TamperMonkey will automatically create a userscript section for you on a script creation.

<details>

    <summary>The default script</summary>
```JS
// ==UserScript==
// @name         Name
// @namespace    Namespace
// @version      Version
// @description  Description
// @author       Author
// @match        Site
// @icon         Icon
// @grant        Grant
// ==/UserScript==

(function() {
    'use strict';

    // Your code here...
})();
```
Every header besides `@match` or `@include` is optional. (You need to choose between one).
Enclose headers in the `==UserScript` and `==/UserScript==` tags.

Now you know some key foundational concepts for scripting! Time to start programming :)
