# The Big 3
Before you start coding your script, you should know which three categories it falls under.
This can help you plan ahead and write cleaner code.

### The 3 main types of scripts
<summary>Click me!</summary>

<Tabs className="unique-tabs">
  <TabItem value="Visual">üíª<b>Visual</b> scripts are client-side only and do not affect others. <i>Most</i> (not all) developers usually don't punish these types of scripts, as long as they don't devolve into Client-side scripts. These scripts do not take input from the server so they are undetectable.</TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Client">üñ•Ô∏è<b>Client</b> scripts may indirectly hurt other players by giving <i>unfair</i> advantages. They come in many shapes and forms by manipulating the allowed client-side inputs to their advantage. They can also take server-side input and act upon that.</TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Server">üßë‚Äçüíª<b>Server-side</b> scripts are the holy grail for most scripters. They can give <u>broken</u> gameplay advantages that a normal player couldn't get, <i>no matter</i> how long they played. These types of scripts are very complex, often-times not public (I only have my hands on two via some lengthy group collaboration), and involve hefty processes such as opening backdoors to the server.</TabItem>

### How to use scripts
For smaller scripts, one can usually get away with pasting in your `console`.

However, for more sophisticated scripts, something in the monkey family is recommended (Yes, I had to say that). This tutorial uses [**TamperMonkey**](https://tampermonkey.net) for all the scripts, however something such as [**ViolentMonkey**](https://ViolentMonkey.github.io) would work the same.

### What we will be making

In this tutorial, we will make a visual script for [**TamperMonkey**](https://tampermonkey.net).

The script will be a visual **representation of client-side inputs**. To word that in English, it will allow us to see what keys are being pressed.
