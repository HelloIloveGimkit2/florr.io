# Create a script
How to start shaping the skeleton of your script.

##### There are 3 main types of scripts

<Tabs className="unique-tabs">
  <TabItem value="Visual">üíª<b>Visual</b> scripts are client-side only and do not affect others. <i>Most</i> (not all) developers usually don't punish these types of scripts, as long as they don't devolve into Client-side scripts.</TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Client">üñ•Ô∏è<b>Client</b> scripts may indirectly hurt other players by giving <i>unfair</i> advantages. They come in many shapes and forms by manipulating the allowed client-side inputs to their advantage.</TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Server"><b>Server-side</b> scripts are the holy grail for most scripters. They can give <u>broken</u> gameplay advantages that a normal player couldn't get, <i>no matter</i> how long they played. These types of scripts are very complex, often-times not public (I only have my hands on two via some lengthy group collaboration), and involve hefty processes such as opening backdoors to the server.</TabItem>
