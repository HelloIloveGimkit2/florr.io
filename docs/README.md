# Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

To contribute, follow the installation steps below to localhost the site, then make a pull request with your added changes.


### Installation with npm
```bash
npm i
npm start
```
### With yarn

```
$ yarn
$ yarn start
```
This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server. All blog changes should be reflected upon saving the document. 

Make sure you run `cd docs` or navigate to the correct directory before starting.

If you are unable to get this site started, you can also see [https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features) for the blog syntax. It's very easy to learn.

Make sure to use `{/* truncate */}` for a .mdx file or `<!-- truncate-->` for a .md file so your entire story isn't displayed. I would recommend having 1-2 sentences displayed. If you do not truncate your blog for the preview, or show too much text, your story will be rejected. Have a good hook if you want people to read your story.
