# Scripts!
Scripts for a bunch of random io games.
### Go [here](smaller-games) for smaller io games. 
<br> Larger games are located in the `scripts` directory.

All scripts are credited if not made by me
<br> (A lot are made by me though)
<br> If you don't find your game in the `scripts` directory 
<br> or the `scripts/smaller-games` directory I might have not
<br> added it yet. Make a [new issue](https://github.com/cat2d2/florr.io/issues/new) and I'll see what I can do :)

If you have made a script for a game, 
<br> make a Pull Request on this repository.
<br> Make sure everything is well-documented
<br> and user-friendly ish. A user shouldn't
<br> have to install wsl to get it working ðŸ’€
