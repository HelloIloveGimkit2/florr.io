# Some scripts you may come across while traveling here.

- *WGB means "won't get you banned"*
- **Tracers**: Traces flowers, mobs, and summoned pets.
- **Auto Grind**: Grinds with mouse movement.
- **Craft Progress**: Allows you to input a petal goal and tracks it for you. (Made by Furaken) *WGB*
- **Guild Script**: Creates a simple script to show guild updates. *WGB*
- **Shaders**: Add realistic shadows to the game! (Fixed by me, original by Jekyll) *WGB*
- **Anti-AFK**: Navigate to the file directory with `cd scripts/florr.io/python-anti-afk`, execute `pip install -r requirements.txt` in your terminal, then run the python script `anti-afk.py`. (Bingo[...]
- **Free Sandbox**: Script by k2r_n2iq, uses memory editing to simulate every petal in your inventory. For this script, you paste it in the console, not with tampermonkey.
- **Account Creator**: Script by Bloss, generates a new guest UUID and edits your localstorage to that ID, giving you a new account. *WGB If used correctly*
- **Version Hash Finder**: Finds your version hash to replace with the old one if super-petals.js doesn't work. If you don't know how to do this, ping me on Discord and I'll update the script.
- **Happy 9/11 Day!**: Replaces favicon and title with 9/11 material (Took me a grand total of 23 seconds to write. Yes, I timed it.)

### Tutorials how to operate:
- Tracers, autogrind, autorespawn, all things in hacks.js can be changed to true or false. (1 or 0)
- To operate shaders, press `+`. (Make sure to hold down shift)


- For anything in the `memory-editing` directory, execute in console.
#### Beginner tutorial:
Go to the 3 little dots on the top-right of your screen. Open dev tools, navigate to your console, and paste the script. If a warning appears and nothing is pasted, type `allow pasting` before hitting enter. If nothing happens, some values may be outdated.
