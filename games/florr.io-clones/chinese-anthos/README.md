### *‚ú® Terminal Tips!*
- When running commands in a terminal, run them one at a time. Each new line is a new command.
- When running commands in a terminal, don't use a slash prefix. It's not MineCraft, you little kids.
- Use `ctrl` + `shift` + ` to open your terminal like a pro! (Then join the Discord and buy my coding courses to become a real pro.)
